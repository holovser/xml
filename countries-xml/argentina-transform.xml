<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><introduction>

In 1816, the United Provinces of the Rio Plata declared their
independence from Spain. After Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay went
their separate ways, the area that remained became Argentina. The
country's population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants
from throughout Europe, with Italy and Spain providing the largest
percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Up until about the
mid-20th century, much of Argentina's history was dominated by
periods of internal political unrest and conflict between civilian
and military factions.
After World War II, an era of Peronist populism and direct and
indirect military interference in subsequent governments was
followed by a military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy
returned in 1983 after a failed bid to seize the Falkland Islands
(Islas Malvinas) by force, and has persisted despite numerous
challenges, the most formidable of which was a severe economic
crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent public protests and the
successive resignations of several presidents. The years 2003-15
saw Peronist rule by Nestor and Cristina FERNANDEZ de KIRCHNER,
whose policies isolated Argentina and caused economic stagnation.
With the election of Mauricio MACRI in November 2015, Argentina
began a period of reform and international reintegration.

</population><description>

Argentina's population continues to grow but at a slower rate
because of its steadily declining birth rate. Argentina's fertility
decline began earlier than in the rest of Latin America, occurring
most rapidly between the early 20th century and the 1950s, and then
becoming more gradual. Life expectancy has been improving, most
notably among the young and the poor. While the population under
age 15 is shrinking, the youth cohort - ages 15-24 - is the largest
in Argentina's history and will continue to bolster the working-age
population. If this large working-age population is well-educated
and gainfully employed, Argentina is likely to experience an
economic boost and possibly higher per capita savings and
investment. Although literacy and primary school enrollment are
nearly universal, grade repetition is problematic and secondary
school completion is low. Both of these issues vary widely by
region and socioeconomic group.
Argentina has been primarily a country of immigration for most
of its history, welcoming European immigrants (often providing
needed low-skilled labor) after its independence in the 19th
century and attracting especially large numbers from Spain and
Italy. More than 7 million European immigrants are estimated to
have arrived in Argentina between 1880 and 1930, when it adopted a
more restrictive immigration policy. European immigration also
began to wane in the 1930s because of the global depression. The
inflow rebounded temporarily following WWII and resumed its decline
in the 1950s when Argentina's military dictators tightened
immigration rules and European economies rebounded. Regional
migration increased, however, supplying low-skilled workers
escaping economic and political instability in their home
countries. As of 2015, immigrants made up almost 5% of Argentina's
population, the largest share in South America. Migration from
neighboring countries accounted for approximately 80% of
Argentina's immigrant population in 2015.
The first waves of highly skilled Argentine emigrant workers
headed mainly to the United States and Spain in the 1960s and
1970s, driven by economic decline and repressive military
dictatorships. The 2008 European economic crisis drove the return
migration of some Argentinean and other Latin American nationals,
as well as the immigration of Europeans to South America, where
Argentina was a key recipient. In 2015, Argentina received the
highest number of legal migrants in Latin America and the
Caribbean. The majority of its migrant inflow came from Paraguay
and Bolivia.

</government><economy>

Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a highly
literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a
diversified industrial base. Although one of the world's wealthiest
countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the 20th
century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal and
current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external debt,
and capital flight.
Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER succeeded her husband as
president in late 2007, and in 2008 the rapid economic growth of
previous years slowed sharply as government policies held back
exports and the world economy fell into recession. In 2010 the
economy rebounded strongly, but slowed in late 2011 even as the
government continued to rely on expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies, which kept inflation in the double digits.
In order to deal with these problems, the government expanded
state intervention in the economy: it nationalized the oil company
YPF from Spain's Repsol, expanded measures to restrict imports, and
further tightened currency controls in an effort to bolster foreign
reserves and stem capital flight. Between 2011 and 2013, Central
Bank foreign reserves dropped $21.3 billion from a high of $52.7
billion. In July 2014, Argentina and China agreed on an $11 billion
currency swap; the Argentine Central Bank has received the
equivalent of $3.2 billion in Chinese yuan, which it counts as
international reserves.
With the election of President Mauricio MACRI in November 2015,
Argentina began a historic political and economic transformation,
as his administration took steps to liberalize the Argentine
economy, lifting capital controls, floating the peso, removing
export controls on some commodities, cutting some energy subsidies,
and reforming the country’s official statistics. Argentina
negotiated debt payments with holdout bond creditors, continued
working with the IMF to shore up its finances, and returned to
international capital markets in April 2016.
In 2017, Argentina’s economy emerged from recession with GDP
growth of nearly 3.0%. The government passed important pension,
tax, and fiscal reforms. And after years of international
isolation, Argentina took on several international leadership
roles, including hosting the World Economic Forum on Latin America
and the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference, and is set
to assume the presidency of the G-20 in 2018.
