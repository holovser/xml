<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><country><name>Yemen</name><introduction>

The Kingdom of Yemen (colloquially known as North Yemen) became
independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1918 and in 1962 became the
Yemen Arab Republic. The British, who had set up a protectorate
area around the southern port of Aden in the 19th century, withdrew
in 1967 from what became the People's Republic of Southern Yemen
(colloquially known as South Yemen). Three years later, the
southern government adopted a Marxist orientation and changed the
country's name to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The
massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from the south
to the north contributed to two decades of hostility between the
states. The two countries were formally unified as the Republic of
Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist movement and brief civil war
in 1994 was quickly subdued. In 2000, Saudi Arabia and Yemen agreed
to delineate their border.
Fighting in the northwest between the government and the Huthis,
a Zaydi Shia Muslim minority, continued intermittently from 2004 to
2010, and then again from 2014-present. The southern secessionist
movement was revitalized in 2007.
Public rallies in Sana'a against then President Ali Abdallah
SALIH - inspired by similar demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt -
slowly built momentum starting in late January 2011 fueled by
complaints over high unemployment, poor economic conditions, and
corruption. By the following month, some protests had resulted in
violence, and the demonstrations had spread to other major cities.
By March the opposition had hardened its demands and was unifying
behind calls for SALIH's immediate ouster. In April 2011, the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), in an attempt to mediate the crisis in
Yemen, proposed the GCC Initiative, an agreement in which the
president would step down in exchange for immunity from
prosecution. SALIH's refusal to sign an agreement led to further
violence. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 2014 in October
2011 calling for an end to the violence and completing a power
transfer deal. In November 2011, SALIH signed the GCC Initiative to
step down and to transfer some of his powers to Vice President Abd
Rabuh Mansur HADI. Following HADI's uncontested election victory in
February 2012, SALIH formally transferred all presidential powers.
In accordance with the GCC Initiative, Yemen launched a National
Dialogue Conference (NDC) in March 2013 to discuss key
constitutional, political, and social issues. HADI concluded the
NDC in January 2014 and planned to begin implementing subsequent
steps in the transition process, including constitutional drafting,
a constitutional referendum, and national elections.
The Huthis, perceiving their grievances were not addressed in
the NDC, joined forces with SALIH and expanded their influence in
northwestern Yemen, which culminated in a major offensive against
military units and rival tribes and enabled their forces to overrun
the capital, Sanaa, in September 2014. In January 2015, the Huthis
surrounded the presidential palace, HADI's residence, and key
government facilities, prompting HADI and the cabinet to submit
their resignations. HADI fled to Aden in February 2015 and
rescinded his resignation. He subsequently escaped to Oman and then
moved to Saudi Arabia and asked the GCC to intervene militarily in
Yemen to protect the legitimate government from the Huthis. In
March, Saudi Arabia assembled a coalition of Arab militaries and
began airstrikes against the Huthis and Huthi-affiliated forces.
Ground fighting between Huthi-aligned forces and anti-Huthi groups
backed by the Saudi-led coalition continued through 2016. In 2016,
the UN brokered a months-long cessation of hostilities that reduced
airstrikes and fighting, and initiated peace talks in Kuwait.
However, the talks ended without agreement. The Huthis and SALIH’s
political party announced a Supreme Political Council in August
2016 and a National Salvation Government, including a prime
minister and several dozen cabinet members, in November 2016, to
govern in Sanaa and further challenge the legitimacy of HADI’s
government. However, amid rising tensions between the Huthis and
SALIH, sporadic clashes erupted in mid-2017, and escalated into
open fighting that ended when Huthi forces killed SALIH in early
December 2017. In 2018, anti-Huthi forces made the most battlefield
progress in Yemen since early 2016, most notably in Al Hudaydah
Governorate. In December 2018, the Huthis and Yemeni Government
participated in the first UN-brokered peace talks since 2016,
agreeing to a limited ceasefire in Al Hudaydah Governorate and the
establishment of a UN Mission to monitor the agreement. In April
2019, Yemen’s parliament convened in Say'un for the first time
since the conflict broke out in 2014. In August 2019, violence
erupted between HADI's government and the pro-secessionist Southern
Transition Council (STC) in southern Yemen. In November 2019,
HADI's government and the STC signed a power-sharing agreement to
end the fighting between them.

</government><economy>

Yemen is a low-income country that faces difficult long-term
challenges to stabilizing and growing its economy, and the current
conflict has only exacerbated those issues. The ongoing war has
halted Yemen’s exports, pressured the currency’s exchange rate,
accelerated inflation, severely limited food and fuel imports, and
caused widespread damage to infrastructure. The conflict has also
created a severe humanitarian crisis - the world’s largest cholera
outbreak currently at nearly 1 million cases, more than 7 million
people at risk of famine, and more than 80% of the population in
need of humanitarian assistance.
Prior to the start of the conflict in 2014, Yemen was highly
dependent on declining oil and gas resources for revenue. Oil and
gas earnings accounted for roughly 25% of GDP and 65% of government
revenue. The Yemeni Government regularly faced annual budget
shortfalls and tried to diversify the Yemeni economy through a
reform program designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy
and foreign investment. In July 2014, the government continued
reform efforts by eliminating some fuel subsidies and in August
2014, the IMF approved a three-year, $570 million Extended Credit
Facility for Yemen.
However, the conflict that began in 2014 stalled these reform
efforts and ongoing fighting continues to accelerate the country’s
economic decline. In September 2016, President HADI announced the
move of the main branch of Central Bank of Yemen from Sanaa to Aden
where his government could exert greater control over the central
bank’s dwindling resources. Regardless of which group controls the
main branch, the central bank system is struggling to function.
Yemen’s Central Bank’s foreign reserves, which stood at roughly
$5.2 billion prior to the conflict, have declined to negligible
amounts. The Central Bank can no longer fully support imports of
critical goods or the country’s exchange rate. The country also is
facing a growing liquidity crisis and rising inflation. The private
sector is hemorrhaging, with almost all businesses making
substantial layoffs. Access to food and other critical commodities
such as medical equipment is limited across the country due to
security issues on the ground. The Social Welfare Fund, a cash
transfer program for Yemen’s neediest, is no longer operational and
has not made any disbursements since late 2014.
Yemen will require significant international assistance during
and after the protracted conflict to stabilize its economy.
Long-term challenges include a high population growth rate, high
unemployment, declining water resources, and severe food
scarcity.
