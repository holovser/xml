<country><name>Nepal</name><introduction>

During the late 18th-early 19th centuries, the principality of
Gorkha united many of the other principalities and states of the
sub-Himalayan region into a Nepali Kingdom. Nepal retained its
independence following the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16 and the
subsequent peace treaty laid the foundations for two centuries of
amicable relations between Britain and Nepal. (The Brigade of
Gurkhas continues to serve in the British Army to the present day.)
In 1951, the Nepali monarch ended the century-old system of rule by
hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system that brought
political parties into the government. That arrangement lasted
until 1960, when political parties were again banned, but was
reinstated in 1990 with the establishment of a multiparty democracy
within the framework of a constitutional monarchy.
An insurgency led by Maoists broke out in 1996. During the
ensuing 10-year civil war between Maoist and government forces, the
monarchy dissolved the cabinet and parliament and re-assumed
absolute power in 2002, after the crown prince massacred the royal
family in 2001. A peace accord in 2006 led to the promulgation of
an interim constitution in 2007. Following a nationwide Constituent
Assembly (CA) election in 2008, the newly formed CA declared Nepal
a federal democratic republic, abolished the monarchy, and elected
the country's first president. After the CA failed to draft a
constitution by a 2012 deadline set by the Supreme Court,
then-Prime Minister Baburam BHATTARAI dissolved the CA. Months of
negotiations ensued until 2013 when the major political parties
agreed to create an interim government headed by then-Chief Justice
Khil Raj REGMI with a mandate to hold elections for a new CA.
Elections were held in 2013, in which the Nepali Congress (NC) won
the largest share of seats in the CA and in 2014 formed a coalition
government with the second-place Communist Party of Nepal-Unified
Marxist-Leninist (UML) with NC President Sushil KOIRALA serving as
prime minister. Nepal's new constitution came into effect in 2015,
at which point the CA became the Parliament. Khagda Prasad Sharma
OLI served as the first post-constitution prime minister from 2015
to 2016. OLI resigned ahead of a no-confidence motion against him,
and Parliament elected Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M)
leader Pushpa Kamal DAHAL (aka "Prachanda") prime minister. The
constitution provided for a transitional period during which three
sets of elections – local, provincial, and national – needed to
take place. The first local elections in 20 years occurred in three
phases between May and September 2017, and state and federal
elections proceeded in two phases in November and December 2017.
The parties headed by OLI and DAHAL ran in coalition and swept the
parliamentary elections, and OLI, who led the larger of the two
parties, was sworn in as prime minister in February 2018. In May
2018, OLI and DAHAL announced the merger of their parties - the UML
and CPN-M - to establish the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), which is
now the ruling party in Parliament.

crimson red with a blue
border around the unique shape of two overlapping right triangles;
the smaller, upper triangle bears a white stylized moon and the
larger, lower triangle displays a white 12-pointed sun; the color
red represents the rhododendron (Nepal's national flower) and is a
sign of victory and bravery, the blue border signifies peace and
harmony; the two right triangles are a combination of two single
pennons (pennants) that originally symbolized the Himalaya
Mountains while their charges represented the families of the king
(upper) and the prime minister, but today they are understood to
denote Hinduism and Buddhism, the country's two main religions; the
moon represents the serenity of the Nepalese people and the shade
and cool weather in the Himalayas, while the sun depicts the heat
and higher temperatures of the lower parts of Nepal; the moon and
the sun are also said to express the hope that the nation will
endure as long as these heavenly bodies

enacted law, or simply by tradition. Although most anthems contain
lyrics, some do not. 

name: "Sayaun Thunga Phool Ka" (Hundreds of
Flowers)
lyrics/music: Pradeep Kumar RAI/Ambar

note: adopted 2007; after the abolition of the
monarchy in 2006, a new anthem was required because of the previous

</government><economy>

Nepal is among the least developed countries in the world, with
about one-quarter of its population living below the poverty line.
Nepal is heavily dependent on remittances, which amount to as much
as 30% of GDP. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,
providing a livelihood for almost two-thirds of the population but
accounting for less than a third of GDP. Industrial activity mainly
involves the processing of agricultural products, including pulses,
jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain.
Nepal has considerable scope for exploiting its potential in
hydropower, with an estimated 42,000 MW of commercially feasible
capacity. Nepal has signed trade and investment agreements with
India, China, and other countries, but political uncertainty and a
difficult business climate have hampered foreign investment. The
United States and Nepal signed a $500 million Millennium Challenge
Corporation Compact in September 2017 which will expand Nepal’s
electricity infrastructure and help maintain transportation
infrastructure.
Massive earthquakes struck Nepal in early 2015, which damaged or
destroyed infrastructure and homes and set back economic
development. Although political gridlock and lack of capacity have
hindered post-earthquake recovery, government-led reconstruction
efforts have progressively picked up speed, although many hard hit
areas still have seen little assistance. Additional challenges to
Nepal's growth include its landlocked geographic location,
inconsistent electricity supply, and underdeveloped transportation
infrastructure.
