<country><name>Cyprus</name><introduction>
    A former British colony,
    Cyprus became independent in 1960 following years of resistance to
    British rule. Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and
    Turkish Cypriot minority communities came to a head in December
    1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite
    the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal
    violence continued, forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves
    throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored
    attempt to overthrow the elected president of Cyprus was met by
    military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than
    a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot administered
    area declared itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"
    ("TRNC"), but it is recognized only by Turkey. An UN-mediated
    agreement, the Annan Plan, failed to win approval by both
    communities in 2004. In February 2014, after a hiatus of nearly two
    years, the leaders of the two communities resumed formal
    discussions under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the divided
    island. The most recent round of negotiations to reunify the island
    were suspended in July 2017 after failure to achieve a
    breakthrough. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004,
    although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations
    - applies only to the areas under the internationally recognized
    government, and is suspended in the "TRNC." However, individual
    Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of
    Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other
    citizens of EU states.

    Country name: This entry includes all forms of the country's
    name approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as
    an example): conventional long form (Italian Republic),
    conventional short form (Italy), local long form (Repubblica
    Italiana), local short form (Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as
    well as the abbreviation. Also see the Terminology
    note.

    conventional long form: Republic of
    Cyprus
    conventional short form: Cyprus
    local long form: Kypriaki Dimokratia/Kibris
    Cumhuriyeti
    local short form: Kypros/Kibris
    etymology: the derivation of the name
    "Cyprus" is unknown, but the extensive mining of copper metal on
    the island in antiquity gave rise to the Latin word "cuprum" for
    copper

    note: the Turkish Cypriot community, which
    administers the northern part of the island, refers to itself as
    the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" or "TRNC" ("Kuzey Kibris
    Turk Cumhuriyeti" or "KKTC")


    Government type:
    This entry gives the basic form of
    government. Definitions of the major governmental terms are as
    follows. (Note that for some countries more than one definition
    applies.): Absolute monarchy - a form of government where the
    monarch rules unhindered, i.e., without any laws, constitution, or
    legally organized opposition. Anarchy - a condition of lawlessness
    or political disorder brought about by the absence of governmental
    authority. Authoritarian - a form of government in whic . . .
    more


    Republic of Cyprus -
    presidential republic; "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"
    (self-declared) - parliamentary republic with enhanced
    presidency

    note: a separation of the two main ethnic
    communities inhabiting the island began following the outbreak of
    communal strife in 1963; this separation was further solidified
    when a Greek military-junta-supported coup attempt prompted the
    Turkish military intervention in July 1974 that gave the Turkish
    Cypriots de facto control in the north; Greek Cypriots control the
    only internationally recognized government on the island; on 15
    November 1983, then Turkish Cypriot "President" Rauf DENKTAS
    declared independence and the formation of the "TRNC,” which is
    recognized only by Turkey


    Capital: This entry gives the name of the seat of
    government, its geographic coordinates, the time difference

    Flag description:
    This entry provides a written flag
    description produced from actual flags or the best information
    available at the time the entry was written. The flags of
    independent states are used by their dependencies unless there is
    an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and other areas
    do not have flags.

    centered on a white field
    is a copper-colored silhouette of the island (the island has long
    been famous for its copper deposits) above two olive-green-colored,
    crossed olive branches; the branches symbolize the hope for peace
    and reconciliation between the Greek and Turkish communities

    note: one of only two national flags that uses
    a map as a design element; the flag of Kosovo is the other
    note: the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"
    flag retains the white field of the Cyprus national flag but
    displays narrow horizontal red stripes positioned a small distance
    from the top and bottom edges between which are centered a red
    crescent and a red five-pointed star; the banner is modeled after
    the Turkish national flag but with the colors reversed


    National symbol(s):
    A national symbol is a faunal,
    floral, or other abstract representation - or some distinctive
    object - that over time has come to be closely identified with a
    country or entity. Not all countries have national symbols; a few
    countries have more than one.

    Cypriot mouflon (wild
    sheep), white dove; national colors: blue, white

    National anthem:
    A generally patriotic musical
    composition - usually in the form of a song or hymn of praise -
    that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions, or struggles of
    a nation or its people. National anthems can be officially
    recognized as a national song by a country's constitution or by an
    enacted law, or simply by tradition. Although most anthems contain
    lyrics, some do not.

    name: "Ymnos eis tin Eleftherian" (Hymn to
    Liberty)
    lyrics/music: Dionysios SOLOMOS/Nikolaos
    MANTZAROS

    note: adopted 1960; Cyprus adopted the Greek
    national anthem as its own; the Turkish Cypriot community in Cyprus
    uses the anthem of Turkey


</government><economy>

    The area of the Republic of Cyprus under government control has
    a market economy dominated by a services sector that accounts for
    more than four-fifths of GDP. Tourism, finance, shipping, and real
    estate have traditionally been the most important services. Cyprus
    has been a member of the EU since May 2004 and adopted the euro as
    its national currency in January 2008.
    During the first five years of EU membership, the Cyprus economy
    grew at an average rate of about 4%, with unemployment between 2004
    and 2008 averaging about 4%. However, the economy tipped into
    recession in 2009 as the ongoing global financial crisis and
    resulting low demand hit the tourism and construction sectors. An
    overextended banking sector with excessive exposure to Greek debt
    added to the contraction. Cyprus’ biggest two banks were among the
    largest holders of Greek bonds in Europe and had a substantial
    presence in Greece through bank branches and subsidiaries.
    Following numerous downgrades of its credit rating, Cyprus lost
    access to international capital markets in May 2011. In July 2012,
    Cyprus became the fifth euro-zone government to request an economic
    bailout program from the European Commission, European Central Bank
    and the International Monetary Fund - known collectively as the
    "Troika."
    Shortly after the election of President Nikos ANASTASIADES in
    February 2013, Cyprus reached an agreement with the Troika on a $13
    billion bailout that triggered a two-week bank closure and the
    imposition of capital controls that remained partially in place
    until April 2015. Cyprus' two largest banks merged and the combined
    entity was recapitalized through conversion of some large bank
    deposits to shares and imposition of losses on bank bondholders. As
    with other EU countries, the Troika conditioned the bailout on
    passing financial and structural reforms and privatizing
    state-owned enterprises. Despite downsizing and restructuring, the
    Cypriot financial sector remains burdened by the largest stock of
    non-performing loans in the euro zone, equal to nearly half of all
    loans. Since the bailout, Cyprus has received positive appraisals
    by the Troika and outperformed fiscal targets but has struggled to
    overcome political opposition to bailout-mandated legislation,
    particularly regarding privatizations. The rate of non-performing
    loans (NPLs) is still very high at around 49%, and growth would
    accelerate if Cypriot banks could increase the pace of resolution
    of the NPLs.
    In October 2013, a US-Israeli consortium completed preliminary
    appraisals of hydrocarbon deposits in Cyprus’ exclusive economic
    zone (EEZ), which estimated gross mean reserves of about 130
    billion cubic meters. Though exploration continues in Cyprus’ EEZ,
    no additional commercially exploitable reserves have been
    identified. Developing offshore hydrocarbon resources remains a
    critical component of the government’s economic recovery efforts,
    but development has been delayed as a result of regional
    developments and disagreements about exploitation methods.
