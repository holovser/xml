<country><introduction>

In 1816, the United Provinces of the Rio Plata declared their
independence from Spain. After Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay went
their separate ways, the area that remained became Argentina. The
country's population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants
from throughout Europe, with Italy and Spain providing the largest
percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Up until about the
mid-20th century, much of Argentina's history was dominated by
periods of internal political unrest and conflict between civilian
and military factions.
After World War II, an era of Peronist populism and direct and
indirect military interference in subsequent governments was
followed by a military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy
returned in 1983 after a failed bid to seize the Falkland Islands
(Islas Malvinas) by force, and has persisted despite numerous
challenges, the most formidable of which was a severe economic
crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent public protests and the
successive resignations of several presidents. The years 2003-15
saw Peronist rule by Nestor and Cristina FERNANDEZ de KIRCHNER,
whose policies isolated Argentina and caused economic stagnation.
With the election of Mauricio MACRI in November 2015, Argentina
began a period of reform and international reintegration.

</population><description>

Argentina's population continues to grow but at a slower rate
because of its steadily declining birth rate. Argentina's fertility
decline began earlier than in the rest of Latin America, occurring
most rapidly between the early 20th century and the 1950s, and then
becoming more gradual. Life expectancy has been improving, most
notably among the young and the poor. While the population under
age 15 is shrinking, the youth cohort - ages 15-24 - is the largest
in Argentina's history and will continue to bolster the working-age
population. If this large working-age population is well-educated
and gainfully employed, Argentina is likely to experience an
economic boost and possibly higher per capita savings and
investment. Although literacy and primary school enrollment are
nearly universal, grade repetition is problematic and secondary
school completion is low. Both of these issues vary widely by
region and socioeconomic group.
Argentina has been primarily a country of immigration for most
of its history, welcoming European immigrants (often providing
needed low-skilled labor) after its independence in the 19th
century and attracting especially large numbers from Spain and
Italy. More than 7 million European immigrants are estimated to
have arrived in Argentina between 1880 and 1930, when it adopted a
more restrictive immigration policy. European immigration also
began to wane in the 1930s because of the global depression. The
inflow rebounded temporarily following WWII and resumed its decline
in the 1950s when Argentina's military dictators tightened
immigration rules and European economies rebounded. Regional
migration increased, however, supplying low-skilled workers
escaping economic and political instability in their home
countries. As of 2015, immigrants made up almost 5% of Argentina's
population, the largest share in South America. Migration from
neighboring countries accounted for approximately 80% of
Argentina's immigrant population in 2015.
The first waves of highly skilled Argentine emigrant workers
headed mainly to the United States and Spain in the 1960s and
1970s, driven by economic decline and repressive military
dictatorships. The 2008 European economic crisis drove the return
migration of some Argentinean and other Latin American nationals,
as well as the immigration of Europeans to South America, where
Argentina was a key recipient. In 2015, Argentina received the
highest number of legal migrants in Latin America and the
Caribbean. The majority of its migrant inflow came from Paraguay
and Bolivia.

</government><economy>

Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a highly
literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a
diversified industrial base. Although one of the world's wealthiest
countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the 20th
century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal and
current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external debt,
and capital flight.
Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER succeeded her husband as
president in late 2007, and in 2008 the rapid economic growth of
previous years slowed sharply as government policies held back
exports and the world economy fell into recession. In 2010 the
economy rebounded strongly, but slowed in late 2011 even as the
government continued to rely on expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies, which kept inflation in the double digits.
In order to deal with these problems, the government expanded
state intervention in the economy: it nationalized the oil company
YPF from Spain's Repsol, expanded measures to restrict imports, and
further tightened currency controls in an effort to bolster foreign
reserves and stem capital flight. Between 2011 and 2013, Central
Bank foreign reserves dropped $21.3 billion from a high of $52.7
billion. In July 2014, Argentina and China agreed on an $11 billion
currency swap; the Argentine Central Bank has received the
equivalent of $3.2 billion in Chinese yuan, which it counts as
international reserves.
With the election of President Mauricio MACRI in November 2015,
Argentina began a historic political and economic transformation,
as his administration took steps to liberalize the Argentine
economy, lifting capital controls, floating the peso, removing
export controls on some commodities, cutting some energy subsidies,
and reforming the country’s official statistics. Argentina
negotiated debt payments with holdout bond creditors, continued
working with the IMF to shore up its finances, and returned to
international capital markets in April 2016.
In 2017, Argentina’s economy emerged from recession with GDP
growth of nearly 3.0%. The government passed important pension,
tax, and fiscal reforms. And after years of international
isolation, Argentina took on several international leadership
roles, including hosting the World Economic Forum on Latin America
and the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference, and is set
to assume the presidency of the G-20 in 2018.

    <cyprus><country><introduction>
A former British colony,
Cyprus became independent in 1960 following years of resistance to
British rule. Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and
Turkish Cypriot minority communities came to a head in December
1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite
the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal
violence continued, forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves
throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored
attempt to overthrow the elected president of Cyprus was met by
military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than
a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot administered
area declared itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"
("TRNC"), but it is recognized only by Turkey. An UN-mediated
agreement, the Annan Plan, failed to win approval by both
communities in 2004. In February 2014, after a hiatus of nearly two
years, the leaders of the two communities resumed formal
discussions under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the divided
island. The most recent round of negotiations to reunify the island
were suspended in July 2017 after failure to achieve a
breakthrough. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004,
although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations
- applies only to the areas under the internationally recognized
government, and is suspended in the "TRNC." However, individual
Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of
Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other
citizens of EU states.

</government><economy>

The area of the Republic of Cyprus under government control has
a market economy dominated by a services sector that accounts for
more than four-fifths of GDP. Tourism, finance, shipping, and real
estate have traditionally been the most important services. Cyprus
has been a member of the EU since May 2004 and adopted the euro as
its national currency in January 2008.
During the first five years of EU membership, the Cyprus economy
grew at an average rate of about 4%, with unemployment between 2004
and 2008 averaging about 4%. However, the economy tipped into
recession in 2009 as the ongoing global financial crisis and
resulting low demand hit the tourism and construction sectors. An
overextended banking sector with excessive exposure to Greek debt
added to the contraction. Cyprus’ biggest two banks were among the
largest holders of Greek bonds in Europe and had a substantial
presence in Greece through bank branches and subsidiaries.
Following numerous downgrades of its credit rating, Cyprus lost
access to international capital markets in May 2011. In July 2012,
Cyprus became the fifth euro-zone government to request an economic
bailout program from the European Commission, European Central Bank
and the International Monetary Fund - known collectively as the
"Troika."
Shortly after the election of President Nikos ANASTASIADES in
February 2013, Cyprus reached an agreement with the Troika on a $13
billion bailout that triggered a two-week bank closure and the
imposition of capital controls that remained partially in place
until April 2015. Cyprus' two largest banks merged and the combined
entity was recapitalized through conversion of some large bank
deposits to shares and imposition of losses on bank bondholders. As
with other EU countries, the Troika conditioned the bailout on
passing financial and structural reforms and privatizing
state-owned enterprises. Despite downsizing and restructuring, the
Cypriot financial sector remains burdened by the largest stock of
non-performing loans in the euro zone, equal to nearly half of all
loans. Since the bailout, Cyprus has received positive appraisals
by the Troika and outperformed fiscal targets but has struggled to
overcome political opposition to bailout-mandated legislation,
particularly regarding privatizations. The rate of non-performing
loans (NPLs) is still very high at around 49%, and growth would
accelerate if Cypriot banks could increase the pace of resolution
of the NPLs.
In October 2013, a US-Israeli consortium completed preliminary
appraisals of hydrocarbon deposits in Cyprus’ exclusive economic
zone (EEZ), which estimated gross mean reserves of about 130
billion cubic meters. Though exploration continues in Cyprus’ EEZ,
no additional commercially exploitable reserves have been
identified. Developing offshore hydrocarbon resources remains a
critical component of the government’s economic recovery efforts,
but development has been delayed as a result of regional
developments and disagreements about exploitation methods.

    <yemen><country><introduction>

The Kingdom of Yemen (colloquially known as North Yemen) became
independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1918 and in 1962 became the
Yemen Arab Republic. The British, who had set up a protectorate
area around the southern port of Aden in the 19th century, withdrew
in 1967 from what became the People's Republic of Southern Yemen
(colloquially known as South Yemen). Three years later, the
southern government adopted a Marxist orientation and changed the
country's name to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The
massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from the south
to the north contributed to two decades of hostility between the
states. The two countries were formally unified as the Republic of
Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist movement and brief civil war
in 1994 was quickly subdued. In 2000, Saudi Arabia and Yemen agreed
to delineate their border.
Fighting in the northwest between the government and the Huthis,
a Zaydi Shia Muslim minority, continued intermittently from 2004 to
2010, and then again from 2014-present. The southern secessionist
movement was revitalized in 2007.
Public rallies in Sana'a against then President Ali Abdallah
SALIH - inspired by similar demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt -
slowly built momentum starting in late January 2011 fueled by
complaints over high unemployment, poor economic conditions, and
corruption. By the following month, some protests had resulted in
violence, and the demonstrations had spread to other major cities.
By March the opposition had hardened its demands and was unifying
behind calls for SALIH's immediate ouster. In April 2011, the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), in an attempt to mediate the crisis in
Yemen, proposed the GCC Initiative, an agreement in which the
president would step down in exchange for immunity from
prosecution. SALIH's refusal to sign an agreement led to further
violence. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 2014 in October
2011 calling for an end to the violence and completing a power
transfer deal. In November 2011, SALIH signed the GCC Initiative to
step down and to transfer some of his powers to Vice President Abd
Rabuh Mansur HADI. Following HADI's uncontested election victory in
February 2012, SALIH formally transferred all presidential powers.
In accordance with the GCC Initiative, Yemen launched a National
Dialogue Conference (NDC) in March 2013 to discuss key
constitutional, political, and social issues. HADI concluded the
NDC in January 2014 and planned to begin implementing subsequent
steps in the transition process, including constitutional drafting,
a constitutional referendum, and national elections.
The Huthis, perceiving their grievances were not addressed in
the NDC, joined forces with SALIH and expanded their influence in
northwestern Yemen, which culminated in a major offensive against
military units and rival tribes and enabled their forces to overrun
the capital, Sanaa, in September 2014. In January 2015, the Huthis
surrounded the presidential palace, HADI's residence, and key
government facilities, prompting HADI and the cabinet to submit
their resignations. HADI fled to Aden in February 2015 and
rescinded his resignation. He subsequently escaped to Oman and then
moved to Saudi Arabia and asked the GCC to intervene militarily in
Yemen to protect the legitimate government from the Huthis. In
March, Saudi Arabia assembled a coalition of Arab militaries and
began airstrikes against the Huthis and Huthi-affiliated forces.
Ground fighting between Huthi-aligned forces and anti-Huthi groups
backed by the Saudi-led coalition continued through 2016. In 2016,
the UN brokered a months-long cessation of hostilities that reduced
airstrikes and fighting, and initiated peace talks in Kuwait.
However, the talks ended without agreement. The Huthis and SALIH’s
political party announced a Supreme Political Council in August
2016 and a National Salvation Government, including a prime
minister and several dozen cabinet members, in November 2016, to
govern in Sanaa and further challenge the legitimacy of HADI’s
government. However, amid rising tensions between the Huthis and
SALIH, sporadic clashes erupted in mid-2017, and escalated into
open fighting that ended when Huthi forces killed SALIH in early
December 2017. In 2018, anti-Huthi forces made the most battlefield
progress in Yemen since early 2016, most notably in Al Hudaydah
Governorate. In December 2018, the Huthis and Yemeni Government
participated in the first UN-brokered peace talks since 2016,
agreeing to a limited ceasefire in Al Hudaydah Governorate and the
establishment of a UN Mission to monitor the agreement. In April
2019, Yemen’s parliament convened in Say'un for the first time
since the conflict broke out in 2014. In August 2019, violence
erupted between HADI's government and the pro-secessionist Southern
Transition Council (STC) in southern Yemen. In November 2019,
HADI's government and the STC signed a power-sharing agreement to
end the fighting between them.

</government><economy>

Yemen is a low-income country that faces difficult long-term
challenges to stabilizing and growing its economy, and the current
conflict has only exacerbated those issues. The ongoing war has
halted Yemen’s exports, pressured the currency’s exchange rate,
accelerated inflation, severely limited food and fuel imports, and
caused widespread damage to infrastructure. The conflict has also
created a severe humanitarian crisis - the world’s largest cholera
outbreak currently at nearly 1 million cases, more than 7 million
people at risk of famine, and more than 80% of the population in
need of humanitarian assistance.
Prior to the start of the conflict in 2014, Yemen was highly
dependent on declining oil and gas resources for revenue. Oil and
gas earnings accounted for roughly 25% of GDP and 65% of government
revenue. The Yemeni Government regularly faced annual budget
shortfalls and tried to diversify the Yemeni economy through a
reform program designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy
and foreign investment. In July 2014, the government continued
reform efforts by eliminating some fuel subsidies and in August
2014, the IMF approved a three-year, $570 million Extended Credit
Facility for Yemen.
However, the conflict that began in 2014 stalled these reform
efforts and ongoing fighting continues to accelerate the country’s
economic decline. In September 2016, President HADI announced the
move of the main branch of Central Bank of Yemen from Sanaa to Aden
where his government could exert greater control over the central
bank’s dwindling resources. Regardless of which group controls the
main branch, the central bank system is struggling to function.
Yemen’s Central Bank’s foreign reserves, which stood at roughly
$5.2 billion prior to the conflict, have declined to negligible
amounts. The Central Bank can no longer fully support imports of
critical goods or the country’s exchange rate. The country also is
facing a growing liquidity crisis and rising inflation. The private
sector is hemorrhaging, with almost all businesses making
substantial layoffs. Access to food and other critical commodities
such as medical equipment is limited across the country due to
security issues on the ground. The Social Welfare Fund, a cash
transfer program for Yemen’s neediest, is no longer operational and
has not made any disbursements since late 2014.
Yemen will require significant international assistance during
and after the protracted conflict to stabilize its economy.
Long-term challenges include a high population growth rate, high
unemployment, declining water resources, and severe food
scarcity.

    <nepal><country><introduction>

During the late 18th-early 19th centuries, the principality of
Gorkha united many of the other principalities and states of the
sub-Himalayan region into a Nepali Kingdom. Nepal retained its
independence following the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16 and the
subsequent peace treaty laid the foundations for two centuries of
amicable relations between Britain and Nepal. (The Brigade of
Gurkhas continues to serve in the British Army to the present day.)
In 1951, the Nepali monarch ended the century-old system of rule by
hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system that brought
political parties into the government. That arrangement lasted
until 1960, when political parties were again banned, but was
reinstated in 1990 with the establishment of a multiparty democracy
within the framework of a constitutional monarchy.
An insurgency led by Maoists broke out in 1996. During the
ensuing 10-year civil war between Maoist and government forces, the
monarchy dissolved the cabinet and parliament and re-assumed
absolute power in 2002, after the crown prince massacred the royal
family in 2001. A peace accord in 2006 led to the promulgation of
an interim constitution in 2007. Following a nationwide Constituent
Assembly (CA) election in 2008, the newly formed CA declared Nepal
a federal democratic republic, abolished the monarchy, and elected
the country's first president. After the CA failed to draft a
constitution by a 2012 deadline set by the Supreme Court,
then-Prime Minister Baburam BHATTARAI dissolved the CA. Months of
negotiations ensued until 2013 when the major political parties
agreed to create an interim government headed by then-Chief Justice
Khil Raj REGMI with a mandate to hold elections for a new CA.
Elections were held in 2013, in which the Nepali Congress (NC) won
the largest share of seats in the CA and in 2014 formed a coalition
government with the second-place Communist Party of Nepal-Unified
Marxist-Leninist (UML) with NC President Sushil KOIRALA serving as
prime minister. Nepal's new constitution came into effect in 2015,
at which point the CA became the Parliament. Khagda Prasad Sharma
OLI served as the first post-constitution prime minister from 2015
to 2016. OLI resigned ahead of a no-confidence motion against him,
and Parliament elected Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M)
leader Pushpa Kamal DAHAL (aka "Prachanda") prime minister. The
constitution provided for a transitional period during which three
sets of elections – local, provincial, and national – needed to
take place. The first local elections in 20 years occurred in three
phases between May and September 2017, and state and federal
elections proceeded in two phases in November and December 2017.
The parties headed by OLI and DAHAL ran in coalition and swept the
parliamentary elections, and OLI, who led the larger of the two
parties, was sworn in as prime minister in February 2018. In May
2018, OLI and DAHAL announced the merger of their parties - the UML
and CPN-M - to establish the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), which is
now the ruling party in Parliament.

Nepal is among the least developed countries in the world, with
about one-quarter of its population living below the poverty line.
Nepal is heavily dependent on remittances, which amount to as much
as 30% of GDP. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,
providing a livelihood for almost two-thirds of the population but
accounting for less than a third of GDP. Industrial activity mainly
involves the processing of agricultural products, including pulses,
jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain.
Nepal has considerable scope for exploiting its potential in
hydropower, with an estimated 42,000 MW of commercially feasible
capacity. Nepal has signed trade and investment agreements with
India, China, and other countries, but political uncertainty and a
difficult business climate have hampered foreign investment. The
United States and Nepal signed a $500 million Millennium Challenge
Corporation Compact in September 2017 which will expand Nepal’s
electricity infrastructure and help maintain transportation
infrastructure.
Massive earthquakes struck Nepal in early 2015, which damaged or
destroyed infrastructure and homes and set back economic
